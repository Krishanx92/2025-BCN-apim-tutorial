# Use Case 03 - Deploy and Publish API

Now that we've created the API and confirmed compliance, we're ready to deploy it to the gateway and publish it on the Developer Portal.

## Step 1: Deploy API to the Gateway

1. Log in to the API Publisher at: `https://<hostname>:9443/publisher` as **larry** using the assigned password.
2. Select the **Product Mgt API** that was designed and navigate to **Deploy → Deployments**.
3. Select the **Default** gateway where you want to deploy the API.
4. Optionally, provide a description for the revision.
5. Click **Deploy**.

This will deploy your API to the gateway, making it available for use by consumers.

## Step 2: Publish API to the Developer Portal

1. After deploying the API to the gateway, log in to the API Publisher as **emily** (API Product Manager) using the assigned password.
2. Select the **Product Mgt API** and navigate to **Publish → Lifecycle**.
3. Click on **Publish** to make the API available on the Developer Portal for developers to view, subscribe to, and start using.

With these steps completed, your API is now deployed to the gateway and published to the Developer Portal, making it available for API consumers and app developers.
