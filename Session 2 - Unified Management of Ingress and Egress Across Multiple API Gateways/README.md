# Session 2: Unified Management of Ingress and Egress Across Multiple API Gateways

In today’s multi-cloud, multi-gateway world, organizations struggle to apply consistent governance across all their APIs—both ingress APIs exposed to consumers and egress APIs calling external services like AI platforms and SaaS applications. This hands-on lab shows you how to solve that with a unified control plane that manages API gateways across environments, including Kubernetes, universal, immutable, and federated gateways (AWS, Solace).

You’ll see how a pluggable agent framework makes it easy to onboard any gateway supporting Kubernetes Gateway API, and how to enforce policies, observability, and analytics consistently across all your traffic—inbound and outbound. The lab will also dive deep into AI egress governance, showcasing features like model routing, prompt templating, semantic caching, and AI guardrails when connecting to OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Mistral.

If you’re looking for a future-proof way to manage all your APIs across diverse platforms, environments, and use cases—this is the session for you.
