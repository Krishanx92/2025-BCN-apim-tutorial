# API Management Labs - 2025 WSO2CON BCN

## Session 1: AI-Driven API Design, Development, and Consumption with Enhanced Governance

As APIs continue to evolve, AI is transforming how they are designed, consumed, and governed. By integrating AI-driven capabilities, organizations can streamline workflows, enhance automation, and ensure compliance—making API management more intelligent, efficient, and adaptive.

This session explores how AI can be applied across the API lifecycle, from intelligent design recommendations to optimizing consumption patterns and enforcing governance policies. Through real-world examples, we will demonstrate how AI enhances API interactions, automates compliance, strengthens security, and integrates seamlessly with development workflows.

By the end of this session, attendees will gain valuable insights into leveraging AI for API management, balancing automation with governance, and building smarter, more secure API ecosystems. Whether you're an API developer, architect, or platform engineer, this session will provide practical strategies for the future of AI-enhanced API management.

## Session 2: Unified Management of Ingress and Egress Across Multiple API Gateways

In today’s multi-cloud, multi-gateway world, organizations struggle to apply consistent governance across all their APIs—both ingress APIs exposed to consumers and egress APIs calling external services like AI platforms and SaaS applications. This hands-on lab shows you how to solve that with a unified control plane that manages API gateways across environments, including Kubernetes, universal, immutable, and federated gateways (AWS, Solace).

You’ll see how a pluggable agent framework makes it easy to onboard any gateway supporting Kubernetes Gateway API, and how to enforce policies, observability, and analytics consistently across all your traffic—inbound and outbound. The lab will also dive deep into AI egress governance, showcasing features like model routing, prompt templating, semantic caching, and AI guardrails when connecting to OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Mistral.

If you’re looking for a future-proof way to manage all your APIs across diverse platforms, environments, and use cases—this is the session for you.
